I had 2024-07-26 day. At all it was more than 20 mln. rows. 
For basic implementation task a and b, implementation using sequantially and pararelising (tasks giving subsets of distinct MMSI). In task-1.py file, this can be seen, due to long waiting time, I used only 7 subsets and 7 workers. The speedup was appr. 2 times.
